### Course Objective
Mathematics is an experimental science. Results do not come first, but later on. In
this course, we will concentrate on how to discover mathematical solutions and statements via computer simulations. Many of the solutions to problems in mathematics
are much easier to be obtained if you get the chance to explore empirical data generated from computer programs. Computer never lies!! The method of simulation
will be useful for your future career whether you work on mathematics, computer
science, or any field of science.

### Topics
A brief review of statistics and probability, methods of estimating pi, the Monty Hall
problem, Benfordâ€™s law, Cfinite recurrences, Poisson clocks and exponential buses,
descent and peak polynomials, X-rays of random permutations, the toilet problem,
one-dimensional random walks on Z, the coupon collector problem and variants.
